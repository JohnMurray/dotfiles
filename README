Project:     Dotfiles
Author:      John Murray

Description:
This "project" contains the Linux dotfiles that I used on all of my systems.
I mainly keep them on here for my own personal storage and use. However if
you find them useful or like a part of them, feel free to download, use, or
borrow the configuration information within them. This is a work-in-progress
for me and will grow and get better over time.


Installation:
  > ./install.py
  > # or
  > rake
This will copy all of the files and directories starting with '.' from the folder
into your $HOME directory (except for the .git dir).
