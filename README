Project:     Dotfiles
Author:      John Murray

Description:
This "project" contains the Linux dotfiles that I used on all of my systems. I mainly keep them on here for my own personal storage and use. However if you find them useful or like a part of them, feel free to download, use, or borrow the configuration information within them. This is a work-in-progress for me and will grow and get better over time.
