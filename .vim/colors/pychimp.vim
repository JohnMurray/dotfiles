" Crated specifically for Python coding ! (For other languages, I do suggest that 
" you find other colorschemes, there are loads !)

" Note: This theme uses ideas from Python IDLE, (and has some similarities) from Molokai theme
" created by Thomas Restrepo
" <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2340>
"
" This colorscheme is specifically created, to work in a translucent
" background provided by terminal and supports 256 color terminals

" Tip -- add <t_Co=256> in your ~/.vimrc to utilize the theme well.
